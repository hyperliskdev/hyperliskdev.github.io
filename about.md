# Carter Tomlenovich

I am currently pursuing a degree in Cybersecurity at flemig College. I have 3 years of junior programming experience from First Robotics Challege (2017-2020). I have expeirence as a financial analyst doing SQL and KPA dashboard for Greenfield Global (2017). My first production programming expeirence was with CubeCraft in 2022. During the enture period from 2017 to the present I have been educating myself through practice projects and taking advantage of school resources. 

I am currently open for remote work, you may contact me in the footer.

I am comfortable with Java, C++ and Rust. I havent really focused on Frontend frameworks but I have worked with Elixir and have a project with typescript in the work.

I am confident in my ability to learn new concepts quickly and have no problem asking for resources and help when I need it.
