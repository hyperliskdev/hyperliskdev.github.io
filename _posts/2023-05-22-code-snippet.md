As an introduction, I want to start doing Leetcode and other problem styles and posting them to my website. Each one will be a single problem, I will go through the problem and take out bits and bytes that interest me and will be useful to solving the problem. Then, I want to work through writing the code and hopefully I can do this for some amount of time before abandoning it.
