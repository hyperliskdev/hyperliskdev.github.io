This will be a blog series containing a bunch of information about the project warehouse and general production programming informations. I want to explore tons of different concepts with warehouse
and with that, record some of the experience I have with tools like Kubernetes, Github Actions, GraphQL and lots of other things too.

To get started on this, we will outline some of the learning goals I have for warehouse.

- Understand how to manage a microservice production environment.
- Understand production GraphQL and the development process for microservices.
- Understanding data analytics for a product like warehouse

tons more likely...


An end product for warehouse would be likely a cloud provider of the service or the ability to self-host the microservices on a cluster and automatically manage things from there.
